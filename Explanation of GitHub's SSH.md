##What is MarkDown?

Markdown is a kind of markup that uses letters to make letters,
This content can cause problems with the content of your blog or website or printout.

Nowadays Markdown is used in many places. WordPress now supports markdown by 
default, and it also supports the Markdown language by default on blog platforms like 
Tumblr and Ghost.

There is also a plug-in that allows you to use Markdown on the GNU board or XE, 
so if you install the plug-in, you can use markdown when writing on GNU board or XE.

##Advantages and Disadvantages of Markdown
###Advantages of Markdown

*easy to read
Markdown is much easier to understand than other markup languages. The title can be 
prefixed with a #, and to emphasize the letters, enclose the letters around **. 
When writing in HTML, it was fairly difficult to imagine how the article would actually 
look in the browser. Text written with markdown can easily be imagined by text alone 
as to how it would look in the browser.

*easy to learn
Markdown is fairly simple. When John Gruber first created the markdown, he designed 
the markdown for the features that people use the most, and the complexity for HTML.
So even though there are some limitations, you can use HTML as it is in the middle of 
writing a markdown.

###Disadvantages of Markdown

*The grammar is toosimple
If the grammar is too simple and you want to get out of it, you might end up writing 
HTML. For example, Markdown does not have a syntax for sorting images. Therefore, 
you need to use the HTML img tag to sort the images. Also, because you can not 
assign a class to a tag, you must also use HTML to specify the class or id.

*There are many expansion grammars.
This is a problem caused by the first disadvantage. Because the grammar is too simple, 
various extensions have begun to solve the inconvenience, and such fragmentation can 
cause the markdown document to work well in one place and not work elsewhere.

*It is inconvenient to insert multimedia
I personally think that Markdown is the biggest disadvantage. When you insert an 
image in the WYSIWYG editor, you usually insert the image using the image upload 
button. But Markdown is just text-only, so the process of inserting an image, uploading
an image, and taking an address is all separate. So the most inconvenient thing when 
writing a blog using Markdown is when you insert an image. However, when you insert
 external videos such as YouTube, it is not much different from WYSIWYG editor. Just 
paste the source and it works fine.
